The solution involves ensuring consistent units within the `calc()` function. Instead of subtracting pixels from a percentage, convert all values to either percentages or pixels before the calculation:

**Solution 1: Using only percentages:**
```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10vw);
  height: calc(100vh - 20vh); 
}
```

**Solution 2: Using only pixels:**
```css
.element {
  width: calc((100% / 100)*990px - 10px);
  height: calc(100vh - 20px);
}
```
This ensures that the calculation is performed using consistent units. Note that using percentages is generally recommended for better responsiveness.
