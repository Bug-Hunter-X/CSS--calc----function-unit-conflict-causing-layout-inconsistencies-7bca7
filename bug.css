The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to the usage of the `calc()` function: 

```css
.element {
  width: calc(100% - 10px);
  height: calc(100vh - 20px); 
}
```

The issue lies in the units used within the `calc()` function. While `100%` is a valid unit for width and `100vh` is a valid unit for height, using `px` as the unit for subtraction causes a conflict when the calculation involves a percentage. This can lead to unexpected behavior, inconsistent layout, or rendering errors in various browsers or situations.
